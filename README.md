# phorbal-image-bot

Small discord bot (using client) that either sends 1 image from the phorbalurl.txt when you mention "phorbal" in a server where the bot is added, or
if you mention p-stats it will give you the amount of files in the phorbalurl.txt. It's sending funny cat images which is grabbed from a tiktok user called 'phorbal'. That's why I called the bot phorbal. It is really easy to set up and use and it makes me smile everytime I use it :)
